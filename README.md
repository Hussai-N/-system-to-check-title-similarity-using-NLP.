# System-to-check-title-similarity-using-NLP.
This project focuses on verifying files by checking for duplicate or existing records based on their titles. The system scans files, books, or documents to see if their titles are already present in the database. If a title does not exist, it will be added to the system. The primary aim is to detect and prevent fraudulent or duplicate documents, books, or files, notifying users about whether a given title is already in the system or not.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask or Django
NLP Libraries: SpaCy, NLTK
Databases: PostgreSQL

Objectives:
The primary objective of this system is to minimize duplication of files, which often leads to redundant or false information being mistaken for authentic. By identifying and rejecting duplicates, the system enhances the accuracy and reliability of content, allowing users access to original, verified files while flagging fraudulent or unwanted copies.
